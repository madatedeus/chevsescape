Installation package for the game Chev's Escape

Chev's Escape was a group project developed by Malik Roc, Cory Pineau, Krishan Singh, Stephen Alpuche and I.
The project is an accumulation of C# files that create a game from scratch, where no engines were used in the process.
The game is entirely object oriented and follows a strict set of scripts.
